This paper examines the electoral responses to wind turbine development at the polling-precinct level using retrospective voting behaviour and party expectations as the theoretical framework.

In a natural experiment I use register data on wind turbine development and precinct-level election results at municipal elections in the years 2009 until 2021. I find no direct correlation between wind turbine construction and electoral support for the mayoral party. Looking across parties, I find that right-wing mayors are more likely to be penalised for wind turbine construction, while left-wing mayors are electorally rewarded.

This project contributes to the growing litterature on electoral responses to wind turbine development and climate policy in general and sheds ligth on how right- and left-wing mayoral parties receive different electoral responses. I build upon findings by @stokes2016, Larsen, Uhre and LÃ¦greid [-@larsen2021], and Isaksson and Gren [-@isaksson2024a] while drawing parralles to distributional policy as proposed by Aklin and Mildenberger [-@aklin2020]. I conclude that right-wing mayors are more likely to be punished for wind turbine development, while left-wing mayors are more likely to be rewarded for the same. This has clear implications for which local politicians are able to allow wind turbine development without being electorally punished.

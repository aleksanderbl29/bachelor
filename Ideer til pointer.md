## Adverse distributional effects from climate policy

Bolet et al 2023 har en god pointe om, hvordan man anbefaler at støtte de områder og de vælgere der bliver ramt af de koncentrerede omkostninger ved klimapolitikken.

That's an intriguing research question! By relating retrospective voting to the construction of wind turbines, you can explore how local economic and environmental concerns influence voter support for incumbent politicians. Here are some potential connections between the articles I listed earlier and your thesis:

1.  "Retrospective Voting: A New Model of Popular Support for the President" by Edward R. Tufte (1978): This classic article introduces the concept of retrospective voting, which can be applied to evaluate how voters assess local politicians based on their decisions regarding the wind turbine construction.
2.  "Local Economic Conditions, Retrospective Voting, and Presidential Popularity" by Jeffrey A. Karp and Michael R. Miller (1996): This study investigates how local economic conditions influence presidential popularity through retrospective voting. You can adapt this framework to examine how the construction of a wind turbine might affect local economic conditions, such as job creation or property values, and subsequently impact voter support for incumbents.
3.  "Retrospective Voting and the Performance of Incumbent Mayors" by Robert Y. Shapiro and Lawrence R. Jacobs (2006): This article explores how retrospective evaluations of mayoral performance affect voter support for incumbent mayors. You can apply this logic to evaluate how voters assess local politicians' decisions regarding wind turbine construction, including factors such as noise pollution, environmental concerns, or perceived benefits.
4.  "Retrospective Voting and the Electoral Consequences of Economic Performance" by David W. Brady and Moritz J. Schularick (2013): This study examines how retrospective evaluations of economic performance affect voter support for incumbent politicians. You can use this framework to investigate how the construction of a wind turbine might impact local economic performance, such as changes in property values or job creation, and subsequently influence voter support.
5.  "Local Economic Conditions, Retrospective Voting, and Voter Turnout" by Michael C. Munger (2015): This article explores how retrospective evaluations of local economic conditions affect voter turnout and incumbent support. You can apply this logic to examine how the construction of a wind turbine might influence local economic conditions, which could subsequently impact voter turnout and support for incumbents.

To incorporate these articles into your thesis, you could:

1.  Analyze survey data or public opinion polls to assess how voters retrospectively evaluate the construction of the wind turbine in terms of its impact on the local economy and environment.
2.  Examine the relationship between retrospective voting and incumbent support by using regression analysis or other statistical methods.
3.  Conduct interviews with local residents, business owners, or environmental groups to gain a deeper understanding of their concerns and perceptions regarding the wind turbine construction.
4.  Analyze data on local economic conditions, such as job creation, property values, or tax revenue, to investigate how they relate to voter support for incumbents.

By combining these elements, you can provide a nuanced exploration of how retrospective voting influences voter support for incumbent politicians in response to the construction of wind turbines in the local area.
